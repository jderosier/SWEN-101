My name is Jensen DeRosier, I went to Bethel High School in Bethel CT, (you know how CT is a block with a stub at the bottom left, thats where I was)

I enjoy coding (duh) and music (listening, playing, writing, really anything to do with music)
I don't really know what else to write but the instructions said paragraph so I guess I'm writing more to make it look like a paragraph


woah -> https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-software-engineering <- is where I go to school

In this class I really want to learn how to
- code
- be better at code
- work better with other code makers
- idk find my true purpose in life


how do I add pictures, uh pretend this is a picture of a brownie
